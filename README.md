Sleeky is a minimal interface package for use with [YOURLS](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS), an open source URL shortener. Sleeky adds a public interface and overhauls the backend (admin) interface. Using this theme you can create your own Bitly / URL shortening site or a shortening site for internal use at companies.

Sleeky is split into two parts - **frontend** and **backend**.
* **Frontend** adds a public user interface. Use this for creating a branded URL shortener or shortening service.
* **Backend** makes the YOURLS backend look a lot prettier and makes various administrative tasks easier.
